# Sideloader

*The missing open-source iOS sideloader.*

Sideloader is an application made to install third-party applications on iOS devices.

You can see it as an open-source replacement of _Cydia Impactor_.

Currently only working on Linux (it was the priority since no easy alternatives exists). \
Windows support is planned (it should not depend on iCloud!). \
The CLI works too on all systems.

I tried to make the code as readable as possible, if you struggle to understand anything
I am here to help!

## How to install

Currently, the only builds available can be downloaded through GitHub Actions.

On Linux, when it will be ready, it will be as simple as installing the Flatpak on your
system, or wait for someone to package it for your distribution.

On Windows, it will get a GitHub Release with a simple executable to run.

Currently, Windows GUI is not working, and the CLI is pretty bare-bones.

Dependencies (runtime): libimobiledevice, libplist-2.X (I attempted to support both 2.2
and 2.3). OpenSSL is currently also needed, but I plan to remove that dependency as soon
as possible (only networking is requiring it).

## How do I build it myself?

### OpenSUSE Tumbleweed:

1. Install the dependencies:
   `sudo zypper in gcc dmd dub libharfbuzz-gobject0 libadwaita libphobos2-0_*`
2. Clone this repository:
   `git clone https://github.com/Dadoum/Sideloader`
3. Enter its directory:
   `cd Sideloader`
4. Build Sideloader:
   `dub build`
5. Enter the bin directory:
   `cd bin`
6. Allow Sideloader to run as a program:
   `chmod +x sideloader`
7. Run Sideloader:
   `./sideloader`

### Other disributions:

Get a recent version `ldc2` or `dmd` installed (an installation script is available on 
[dlang.org](https://dlang.org/)). GNU D compiler won't compile that code (the cryptography
libraries uses SIMD instructions that it can't compile yet).

## How it works?

It works by fetching an iOS development certificate as Xcode would do if you were
developing your own iOS application[^1] and use it to deploy a third party application.

It does not require any Mac or Windows computer, nor any Apple software to be
installed to work. It is just requiring `libimobiledevice` and `libplist`.

It is still requiring you to have an Apple account (which will play the role of the
app developer to Apple), you can use any account for that, don't need to use your actual
Apple ID used with your phone (I recommend making a burner Apple account, see SideStore 
wiki to have easy ways to do that, or on Linux, I'd recommend installing Apple Music on 
Waydroid).

**Your credentials are only ever sent to Apple servers, and you can easily verify this!**\
In general, never trust anyone to handle your credentials, even more if it is in a
closed-source obfuscated application (as-if there were something to hide there ^^).

[^1]: You may wonder if that would allow full iOS application development on Linux, and
the answer is yes! You can compile a native iOS app on Linux with
[theos](https://theos.dev), and then package it into an ipa with `PACKAGE_FORMAT = ipa` to
eventually install it with Sideloader on a real device (or maybe even an emulated one
in the future!) and debug it (with `idevicedebug` or remote `lldb`). _(TODO: add an option
to add the entitlement for debugging)_

## Features

- Sideload
- iOS version range is unknown. 32-bit support is untested. Please report any issue here!!

A dedicated SideStore installer feature is planned with automated pairing file management.

## Notes on platform support

### Linux

Linux version currently only features a GTK frontend. I made one because I was already
familiar with GTK+. I made it in plain code because I really dislike GTK Builder's XML.

### Windows

Windows version uses a Win32 frontend. On Windows 11, it looks terrible. The current
state of GUI libraries on Windows is rather unsatisfying: we have one old well-supported
library across the major versions of Windows, Win32, the one I am using, and then we have
a lot of unsuccessful attempts to supplant it, and finally we have WinUI 3, which looks
good but has no bindings whatsoever (WinRT is supported in C# and C++ only, I would have
to make the bindings myself, which I could do but would take some effort), and is not 
supported everywhere (Windows 10+ only). This is why I used DFL, which is a Windows Forms
like wrapper of Win32 APIs.

**Requirements:** a USB muxer, which is generally iTunes or anything 
distributing AppleMobileDevice. netmuxd should work too if you can't install it for some
reason. OpenSSL is also required for networking, unfortunately.

### macOS

Only the CLI tool is available yet.

GUI support is planned but low-priority as macOS already has more tools to install and
manage iOS apps.

## If you like my software, consider starring or even better: sponsoring me :)

In late 2019, Cydia Impactor stopped working, and the underlying reason also affected
some of my personal projects at the time. At this time, I decided to start the development
of an alternative. I had no experience in reverse-engineering, or even just making complex
request for authentication on a server. Making this project made me a better developer,
but this was not easy to do. 

While most Cydia Impactor alternatives benefited of some Apple software available on
macOS or Windows, (and thus were able to hijack their libraries and reproduce their
behaviour), Apple never released anything targeting the end-user on Linux.

I took 2 years to find a way to overcome the problem that encountered Cydia Impactor
without resorting to reimplementing the full Windows API. I dedicated a lot of work
on this software (alongside my studies). 

That is why I am asking you - if you enjoyed my software and if you can afford it, to 
give me a small tip via [GitHub Sponsors](https://github.com/sponsors/Dadoum).
